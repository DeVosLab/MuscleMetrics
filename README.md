# MuscleMetrics
Interactive tools to facilitate assessment of muscle organisation in _Caenorhabditis elegans_

Includes a segmentation of connected structures and measurement of size, shape and local thickness

Also includes an option to measure directionality 
Segmentation of muscle fibers relies on a directional derivative for which the plugin FeatureJ is used (written by E. Meijiering, https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/)

Elliptic fourier descriptors requires an additional plugin written by Thomas Boudier and Ben Tupper (http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:analysis:fourier_shape_analysis:start)
